# Traffic
 Traffic signs recognition AI model. Uses German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.

- AI to identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph built with Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras (TensorFlow), Scikit-learn, NumPy, and more.

- Used OpenCV to read & resize images from GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) dataset before feeding it to CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for training.

- Used Scikit-learn for splitting dataset conveniently for training & testing.
